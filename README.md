# Board Game Playground

# 1. Introduction

**The project has reached the completion of its staged development but this markdown file is still being edited and not all content has been completed yet.**

This project was developed in my spare time, inspired by my and a few friends' love for board games. However, due to the restrictions of the pandemic, we were unable to meet in person. Consequently, I created this simple online board game software, allowing us to continue enjoying our gaming sessions through the internet. I use C# and WPF as my development tools. Initially, to quickly share this joy with my friends, I only designed some basic features, and the language is Chinese. In the future, if the opportunity and time arise, I hope to further improve and optimize this software, such as more functionalities and different languaages support.

I will briefly introduce the functionality and usage of this software in the following section. Everyone is welcome to download and test it from GitHub. If there are any questions, feel free to email me.
